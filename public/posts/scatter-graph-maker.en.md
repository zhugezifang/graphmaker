## What Is a Scatter Graph?  

Scatter Plot is a type of data visualization chart used to represent the relationship or correlation between two continuous variables. It consists of a series of points or data markers, where the position of each point represents the values of two variables—typically one on the horizontal axis and the other on the vertical axis. Scatter plots are an effective way to visualize the distribution, association, trends, and outliers between two variables.  

## What types of data are suitable for scatter plots?

1. **Relationship Analysis**  
   Scatter plots are most commonly used to display relationships between two variables. By observing a scatter plot, you can quickly determine whether the correlation between variables is positive or negative, as well as the strength of the relationship.  

2. **Data Distribution**  
   Scatter plots can visualize how data is distributed. Clustered data points may indicate a relationship between variables, while scattered points suggest no clear association.  

3. **Trend Analysis**  
   The distribution of points in a scatter plot can reveal trends or patterns, such as linear, curvilinear, or cyclical trends.  

4. **Outlier Detection**  
   Scatter plots help identify outliers—data points that deviate significantly from others, potentially indicating anomalies.  

5. **Correlation Analysis**  
   Scatter plots provide a visual understanding of the strength and direction of correlation between two variables.  

6. **Cluster Analysis**  
   They can reveal clusters or groups within data, highlighting similarities between subsets of data across both variables.  

7. **Experimental Results Visualization**  
   In scientific experiments and engineering studies, scatter plots are used to visualize experimental results, aiding researchers in understanding relationships within the data.
