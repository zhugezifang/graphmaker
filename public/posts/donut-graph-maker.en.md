## What is a Donut Chart?

A donut chart represents data through a circular visualization that resembles a pie chart[/en/pie-graph-maker] with a hollow center. This distinctive graphic divides into sectors that illustrate proportional relationships between different categories relative to the whole dataset. The unique central opening serves as valuable real estate for displaying summary statistics or contextual information, enhancing the overall data comprehension. This structural characteristic makes donut charts particularly effective for communicating part-to-whole relationships in an accessible and visually appealing format. Incorporating such charts into presentations significantly enhances audience data retention and creates more memorable information delivery.

## Why we need to Use Donut Graph?

Donut graphs excel in environments where proportion comparison within datasets must remain visually uncomplicated. Several practical applications include:

Revenue Distribution: Employ this visualization to illustrate how income spreads across different product categories or company segments. For instance, a donut graph might illustrate the proportion of earnings generated from software subscriptions compared to hardware purchases.

Survey Data Visualization: Incorporate response percentages for each available option in questionnaires. This visualization proves particularly valuable when presenting consumer opinions or customer feedback analysis.

Marketing Performance Analysis: Showcase metrics such as website traffic origins (organic searches, paid advertisements, direct referrals, etc.) or promotional campaign effectiveness across different channels.

Financial Resource Distribution: Illustrate how organizational or project funding gets allocated among various initiatives or departments.

Product Line Evaluation: Demonstrate the sales contribution percentage from each product segment, assisting companies in identifying their most successful offerings.
