## What is a Pie Graph?

Pie charts are those round graphs that show you how different parts make up a whole. Think of them like slicing up a pizza - each piece represents something different, and the bigger pieces obviously take up more of the pie. They're super handy when you need to show people at a glance "hey, this chunk is bigger than that one!" Businesses love using them in presentations, and teachers use them all the time to help students visualize data. Just a word of caution though - they work best when you're only comparing a few things. Try cramming too many slices into your pie chart and it becomes a confusing mess that nobody can make sense of!

## Why we need to make Pie Graph?

Pie charts are everywhere these days! Businesses love them for showing stuff like "hey, our company owns this much of the market" or "here's where all our money goes." Teachers use them all the time to break down test scores or show what students thought about something. And researchers? They're always throwing pie charts into their presentations to show who participated in their studies or what people said in surveys. 

The beauty of these charts is how quickly they get the point across - one glance and you can see which slice of the pie is biggest. But here's the thing - they only really work when you're comparing a handful of categories. Try to cram too many slices into your pie and it turns into a confusing mess. When that happens, you're probably better off just using a good old bar chart instead!
