## What is a Pie Graph?

A pie graph, or pie chart, is a circular data visualization tool that displays parts of a whole. Each segment represents a specific category, and the size of the slice is proportional to its share of the total. This simple yet effective diagram helps users quickly understand how different elements contribute to the overall dataset. Pie graphs are commonly used in business and education to present proportions or percentages clearly. However, they are most effective when comparing a limited number of categories, as too many slices can make interpretation difficult.

## Why we need to make Pie Graph?

Pie graphs are commonly used in various fields to visually represent proportions and distributions. In business, they help illustrate market share or budget allocation. In education, pie charts simplify the presentation of survey results or class performance. Researchers often use them to show data breakdowns, such as demographic distributions or survey responses. These charts are ideal when dealing with a small number of categories, as they provide a clear, immediate understanding of how parts compare to the whole. However, when there are too many categories, alternative visuals like bar charts may be more effective.
